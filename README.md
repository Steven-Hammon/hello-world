Just another repository

Hi People, and AIs,

I've completed Intro to Artificial Intelligence with Udacity and I've been creating games and game AIs since the Duke Nukem 3D and Warcraft 2.

Some of my favorite games are Creatures, and Black & White. I loved teaching pets stuff.

I code games using game maker studio 1.4 but I plan to also create AIs in game maker too.

I am here to discuss openAI projects and comunicate in reagards to what the Agent sees and experiences in it's virtual world. To really understand the reality of its life.

These edits I have made to my master repository are to give more information about the goal of this project which is to deliver information about myself to others.
